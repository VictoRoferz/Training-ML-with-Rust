    "##### Instructions\n",
    "Before running, please make sure to install the python packages specified in the `requirements.txt` file and compile the project with `!maturin develop --release`. For your convenience, the cell in section 1 of this notebook has been updated with the necessary commands. The commands assume that a virtual environment has already been created and sourced before running the commands.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Description of the implementation\n",
    "The Rust class `RustDecisionTreeClassifier` exposes the two methods to Python:\n",
    "- fit(x, y): trains the model with the provided dataset and labels\n",
    "- predict(x): predicts the label for the provided datapoints\n",
    "\n",
    "The implementation wraps a parallel Rust decision tree using a thin Python interface built with PyO3. Data is passed as NumPy arrays for zero-copy conversion into Rust’s ndarray types. Heavy computation runs fully in Rust, parallelized with Rayon, while Python's Global Interpeter Lock is released as soon as possible to allow other Python threads to run if necesary.\n",
    "\n",
    "We relied heavility on scikit-learn's own `DecisionTreeClassifier` for our implementation, due to the limited time given for the task and the wish to achieve an efficient implementation of the classifier.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Interpretation of the benchmark results\n",
    "- The Rust classifier matches scikit-learn’s accuracy almost exactly and consistently.\n",
    "- Training and inference are about ~2–4× faster in out Rust implementation\n",
    "- The implementation and the achieved performance gains clearly demonstrate the advantages of choosing Rust for resource-intensive ML application, both in training and inference. Such a big differnce could save a lot of time and resources for the training of bigger AI models.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Resources utilized\n",
    "- Pyo3's docs: https://pyo3.rs/v0.27.1/\n",
    "- scikit-learn's DecisionTreeClassifier class: https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/blob/4e2f1b7094d27ddca17bee1eee61af2ab20a7d23/sklearn/tree/_tree.pxd\n",
